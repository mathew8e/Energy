So you might be asking wtf is this. This python program is a screen recorder which already records fewer images for timelapses. So you don't need to worry about recording a 2 hour 4 gb video and than speeding it up. 

### install

 1. You will need ffmpeg https://www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows. Sorry im a lazy shit and can't make it into a exe file. 
 2. And you will need python 3.
 3. Do pip insatll -r requirements.txt in the folder where the requirements are
 
### usage
`python EnergyScreenTimelapse.py`

Click start and after you will ber done recording close the window and look into the output folder.
